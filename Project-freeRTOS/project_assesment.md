**Assessment of the projects:**

\- *presentations* will take place from **June 4 to 9**;
\- *reports* have to be delivered until **June 9**;



The project presentations will take place over **Zoom** in 30min slots. If needed, this time can be extended. We have defined 30 slots in the referred days, thus with plenty of options. Please, reserve your slot using the following **Doodle**:
(only **1 choice per group** and identify yourself with the **letter of the group**):

If you can present earlier, please, do it, to release the later slots for those that need an extra couple of days.



We will assess the presentations (and the reports) according to the following items::
\- 15%: general **explanation** of the project (context, objetive and specifications)
\- 30%: quality of the **SW architecture** (tasks, shared resources, communications...)
\- 30%: quality of the **operation** (execution of function according to objectives)
\- 25%: assessment of **complexity** (intrinsic difficulty, how much of the course was used)



With respect to the **reports**, use the IEEE conferences paper template:

https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html



The report is limited to **2 pages**, thus you have to be very sharp and concise. The assessment will follow the same items as above, but the "quality of the operation" will be replaced by "quality of the **results**". When applicable, comparing observations with analytical estimations is a plus.

You can add annexes beyond the 2 pages, but we will not consider them directly for grading.

It is mandatory that the report includes, in percentage, the **dedication of each group member**.

Whenever applicable, please, do a **video-clip** of your project and upload to Youtube (include the keywords "SEMB, SETR, FEUP"). Don't forget to identify the authors and the project! Include the link to the video in the report. 

Good work !!!
