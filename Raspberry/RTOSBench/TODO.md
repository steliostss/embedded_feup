# Embedded: To Do

## Report

Regarding the report professors suggested some things:
- Improve communication graphs with better indication for mutexes and semaphores.
- Note contribution of each member in conclusion in percentage (%).

## Tests

We need to improve tests. 
- As mentioned in [Measurements](#Measurements) we should add the primitives as a percentage of the test measurement.
- Implement some/all tests mentioned in the lectures.


## Measurements

The basic principle we should go with is that we should calculate the context switch overhead above each test so we have a better understanding of our measurements. 

**Important**: Fix the graphs. 

Graphs should not be misleading. For example, in one graph we have Raspberry median with Linux minimum.
Concatenate the 5,7,9... tests into one so we can have a better visualization between tests.

This would also lead in less graphs.
