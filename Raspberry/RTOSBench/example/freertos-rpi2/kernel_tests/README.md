# IMAGE test files for Raspberry

I am also putting the outputs from console to these files.

### Important notes
- it has just MAX and MIN, for average we need to *create a script* that parses the file and takes all t1-t2 and makes the average number @todo 

- the program was ran several times (not just once!) so for the statistics we need to take some average values or exclude the nonsence one...

- the most important is to understand what are the timers t1,t2 

- note/question: for round robin I run it now with 2 tasks, is it a problem?

#### done
- round_robin
